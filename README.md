## About

Browsmos is a game the web browser, made entirely using HTML5, and inspired 
heavily by the gameplay of Osmos.

The rules are simple; click to propel yourself around, and try to absorb 
smaller cells until you become the biggest. Watch out for larger cells, or 
they will absorb you!

## Install

Browsmos can also be installed as an app in Chromium or Google Chrome, 
requiring no internet connectivity to play. It can be installed via the
